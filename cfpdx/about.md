# A Bit About Me

Hello! My name is Trevor Johnson a (wannabe) DevOps engineer/Software Architect. I was born and raised in the midwest but I'm now local to the Portland, OR (PDX) area. I have a passion for motorcycles, music, tattoos and my two (fur) baby boys Linux and Lupin. I'm very grateful to have been blessed with some wonderful management and teams in my past experience which has lead me to develop a very "team first, mission first" mindset. I have a deep love for helping other engineers grow as I have so often been the struggling engineer myself. I'm hoping through this site, I can help others who find themselves in my situation find some peace of mind as they can follow in my footsteps to build their own platforms.

My (honest) experience:

### WebMD

I did a 6mo stint my junior year of college via the Portland State University local PDX internship program (PCEP). I mostly fumbled around their build tool powershell Whiskey. I bet I made 1-2 PR's that made it into prod and I'd bet money they aren't anymore XD. I did however co-author a Chef cookbook to install SonarQube on a Windows server. That one, I'm still kinda proud of. We worked our butts off and created something relatively cool for being interns. It was my first introduction to DevOps and it was love at first... project? I do gotta say we had a great manager and a great team supporting us and giving us the space judgement free to be dumb and interns. Shoutout to WebMD Platform Monitoring team!

### The Standard Insurance

Thanks to that same PCEP program I had the luck of once again getting back into the infrastructure world, not as a devops engineer but as a cloud engineer. Once again working with Microsoft based products I was introduced to Terraform for the first time in the form of Azure DevOps. While I would say I did little in the way of actual productivity for them, I was able to get a deep dive with a few wonderful mentors who were able to really break down IaC for me in a meaningful way. Emphasizing the importance of infrastructure idempotency and IaC security.

### LegitScript

This was my first job. Real job. Money was on the line and I was a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for a legacy Ruby on Rails team. Being both on a legacy stack team and also being an SRE I was required to basically drink from the firehose on the daily. I didn't know a lick of Ruby starting out, and they were ok with that. They mostly needed a devops liaison assigned to the dev team, but also just another hand on deck. I wrote tests, scripts, IaC monitored systems, handled incidents, wrote and managed infra Jira tickets and a plethora of other tasks. I kinda became a "jack of all trades" for the team, which has become a recurring theme for me in jobs over my life... Anyways, needless to say I loved it. If you have a chance to apply to them, do it. They treat both their engineers and product side employees with dignity and respect and their business model is super cool!

### Cloud303

While this was my shortest stint so far I think I learned the most lessons from it. I won't go into the muddy details of the situation it ended up being that this position did not work out for me, or them for that matter. In that vein, many of the lessons I learned from this experience were "soft" rather than technical. To me, this was a major lesson in communication during the interview process, and ensuring that the position you are applying for is within your realm of ability, regardless of what anybody else says. As engineers, it is important to be honest with ourselves regarding our current skill level. It is also important to understand that we as applicants are often able to size up a position for ourselves better than the interviewers are able to size us up for those positions. Often times there is a push to "fill seats" for the sake of moving on to the other important work at hand. It is then the responsibility of the applicant to know that "This feels wrong", even when the position is offered. A mentor of mine once told me one of the wisest question to ask in an interview as an applicant. "How did you help the last engineer you hired grow?" This can give applicants insight into the environment they are potentially entering, and give them a better idea whether the position is right for them. Overall I'm grateful for the experience I gained and the unique view into the world of consulting that the position provided to me.

### Current

This leads me to the current. I found myself out of work and in a situation where I needed to show off what I could do, but didn't have a place to put it. Github is nice to show contributor activity, but how do I show off my devops and architectural chops? Devops work can be difficult to properly demonstrate since it usually requires integration with other layers of the stack in order to be visible. So how do I show off my work? How do I show off myself?

My solution came in the form of 3 things:

**1.** Build my own site. If you want something done right... lol. But in all seriousness, if I wanted a place to have the level of control over that I wanted, I was going to have to build it myself. Only one problem.. I'd never built anything from the ground up like this. I was gonna have to level up in a way. Which leads me to..

**2.** Get certified. At least at the basic levels, right? At the very least know what is possible and how everything works on paper. Plus I had some major gaps in my knowledge to fill. So I got my Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) and Developer Associate (DVA) certifications for AWS. While the DVA exam is pretty AWS specific, the SAA exam really presents a clear view into the bigger picture of how software components can be connected and deployed to provide real value to a business. I would say that this exam is what sparked my interest specifically for software architecture and is why the theme of the blog leans more on the architecture side itself and less on the implementation details.

**3.** So now that I got the tools, a teensy bit of cash and the chops to actually build stuff in the cloud what do I do now?.. Blog. I know, shocker right? A software engineer blogging. Super original. But what can I say, it's highly effective (and fun) way of documenting your process. And most importantly, your mistakes. These things you just don't get to see when showing off the end result, yet I find these moments to be some of the most defining in our careers. We (as in I) should really try to write them down and share them more. If anything to let each other know we are not alone. Software is is a humbling field. It teaches through pain. The more pain the more valueable the lesson (usually). We need to always be reminding each other that we are not alone in our journey to master this fickle craft.Â 

That leads me to where I am today. I'm sitting here at my desk blogging about building my site. Where I will blog. About building my site... Where I will blog... About.. building my site.. :)

Well that just about sums me up folks. I'm a pretty open guy and what you read is what you get. I try to write my personality in here a bit so if you like my vibe hit me up!
