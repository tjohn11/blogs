# Introduction

Hello!

First off I should probably introduce myself. My name is Trevor Johnson, the current executive admin and owner of the site codefriendspdx.com. I am responsible for creating, architecting, and prototyping the infrastructure supporting the site.

This blog is intended to follow and document the early stages of the site. I hope to be able to capture my struggles, lessons, screw ups, and anything else I run into. While I have fairly extensive experience with each piece of infrastructure needed to deploy an application, I myself have never personally deployed an entire infrastructure from scratch, so I hope to have many face smashing moments to share. All in all, I hope that from this blog, others can see how they themselves can spin up their own well architected infrastructure, and use it to share their projects and portfolios from the cloud.

## Project Breakdown

The basic concept is of the project overall is simply to iterate over our architecture to serve an increasingly complex system. When will the project be done.. I haven't really decided yet. But if you haven't already seen the mission statement on our About page, follow that link to see the long term goal of what this site is intended to be. For the MVP, we are hoping to have a platform in which we can display our chops for engineering, show off any fun projects, blog, and post relevant documents like resume's and such.

This project is currently rolling out in phases. Waterfall style. Embrace it. Dev in prod till people start caring. Each phase will also get documented in this blog and torn apart by myself and anybody who wishes to comment :). We are starting bad and getting good. By the end we should have something we can feel relatively proud of, and something that serves the original mission statement of the site. Something we can smile when we show off and *hopefully* will get us noticed in this turbulent job market. ;)

## Minor Caveat

While this blog is wholly intended to be for educational purposes, I do have a certain background in architecture and development that I bring, and I'll be speaking to that level. Not because I don't care to explain the nitty gritty details of it all, but because in general this blog is a way to document my overall approach to building a site from scratch in the cloud. I'll try to post as much code and links as I can, but I don't have the time to explain what EC2 is, or what containers are unfortunately. If you have any questions about any part of this blog, do what I do and just copypaste that section and your question into GPT. Usually that'll get the job done XD. That being said, my social media information is publicly available on the site, so if you have any specific question about architectural decisions or implementation details that I don't cover, feel free to hit me up! I'd love to get to know you and hear your comments on the site. :)
